# Loudspeaker Frequency Response ðŸ”Š


Matlab scripts for processing **speaker frequency response** by taking a merge of **far** and **near** impulse reponse measurement.

The scripts were used for a work in a Loudspeakers course teached by Professor Willian D'Andrea at University Federal of Santa Maria,  .

Authors: Eduardo Laux, Gabrielle Hoffmann, Lucas Gomes, Marcelo Brites, Sidney Candido.

## How to use

- Impulse response:

```
% Calculating impulse response 
Response = FrequencyResponse('Time',Measure,'Signal',Excitation_signal,'Type',Near or Far,...
                      'T_win',Time length to cut the signal after the maximum peak);
```

A time data vector or an itaAudio is accepted as the 'time' and 'signal' input parameter.

- Combined response:

```
Merged_response = ProcessMergedResponse(Near_Response,Far_Reponse,'a',Speaker Radius); (Optional: 'c0',sound velocity(default = 343))
```
